# SupervisedModels

#### We are using supervised learning to build a various regression and classification model 

## Project Overview

### 1.  House Price Prediction using Linear Regression
In this project, we use supervised learning to build a Linear Regression model that predicts house prices based on the following features:

    Square footage   
    Number of bedrooms  
    House age

We use the scikit-learn library to implement the linear regression algorithm, and the model is trained on a small dataset containing the features and target values (house prices).

### Dependencies
To run this project, you need to have the following Python libraries installed:

    numpy: For handling arrays and numerical operations.
    scikit-learn: For implementing the Linear Regression model.

### We can install these dependencies using pip:
    pip install numpy scikit-learn
